						<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
						<h2>Alexander Rich</h2>
						<p>Hello! My name is Alex, I'm an Electronics Engineer with 5+ years in high-performance semiconductor design, evaluation, and characterization, now completing my MSc in Electronics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with a focus on integrated photonics.  My career has spanned analog and mixed-signal IC design (including high-speed, high-resolution ADCs in 7nm FinFET), photonic integrated circuit characterization, and high-frequency PCB development. Along the way, I’ve delivered results by bridging technical depth with project execution — from concept to tape-out, from lab characterization to customer-ready solutions.  In addition to engineering roles at Socionext and research at Stanford University, I’ve led cross-functional projects that optimized processes, standardized reporting, and automated test systems — reducing timelines from days to hours. I’ve also built and sold an event audio business, giving me early hands-on experience with client acquisition, contract negotiation, and technical operations.  I thrive in multidisciplinary environments where I can connect people, technology, and business needs. My goal is to deliver impactful, well-engineered solutions that meet technical requirements while exceeding customer expectations.</p>

									<p> This project is an RF detector and signal jammer circuit.  I designed this circuit to first test for the presence of a signal.  After detection of activty, a signal jammer (noise within the given band) is generated to interefere and continues until the presence of the original is gone (no longer picked up by antenna).  I built this circuit for fun and to challenge myself.</p>

									<p>This project explores Real Time Interrupt mechanisms and how to implement them on the 68HC12 microprocessor. This project also helps show an understanding of the difference between maskable and non-maskable interrupts, focusing on how they affect the microprocessor. Using Real Time Interrupts and the internal clock of the microprocessor it is possible to implement more efficient programming techniques.</p>

									<p>This project demonstrates my knowledge of control engineering and uses Matlab and Simulink for calculations and simulations.  Transfer functions represent a systems relationship of the output to the input.  Here I start with a given transfer function (ie system) and show how to deconstruct the function to help gain control of the system.  I analyze the time-domain behavior of the uncompensated system by plotting the step response and determining the transient and steady-state properties.  I also find the damping ratio, natural and undamped frequency, taking into consideration the overall properties of the system, checking the overall stability, steady state error, overshoot and rise time.  This demonstrates my knowledge of how to analyze a given system, reverse engineer, improve a system and predict responses.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Architect.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project shows my ability to build a circuit (Cadence) given certain specifications.  The three circuits I demonstrate are Current Mirror with an ideal current source, a Common Source Amplifier with a resistive load and a Common Source Amplifier then with an active load.  This project is important becuase it shows how I can design a transistor level circuit that meet specifications of say a client.</p>
